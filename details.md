### Yosemite Valley Shuttle

The free [Valley Shuttle](http://www.yosemitepark.com/Files/2015_Yosemite-ShuttleMap.pdf) makes stops at all Yosemite Valley destinations, including the Ahwahnee and Yosemite Lodge at the Falls. In the winter, the shuttle runs from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm every 30 minutes.

The reception ends at 10:00 pm -- don't miss the last shuttle if you plan on partying with us all night!


## [Childcare](#Wunderkind)

Due to the very limited size of our venue, we regret that we can't invite children to our ceremony or reception. Please let us [know](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you'd like us to help set up childcare for your children!
