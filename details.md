## [Travel and transport](#Transport)

### Notable details
* By law, tire chains must be carried in vehicles from October - April. For the latest updates on park conditions, call 209-372-0209.

* The National Park Service collects an entrance [fee](http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/fees.htm) per vehicle, which is good for seven days.

### Parking

 All parking in Yosemite Valley is free of charge. At the Ahwahnee, valet parking is complimentary.

### Yosemite Valley Shuttle

The free Valley [Shuttle](http://www.yosemitepark.com/Files/2015_Yosemite-ShuttleMap.pdf) makes stops at all Yosemite Valley destinations, including the Ahwahnee and Yosemite Lodge at the Falls. In the winter, the Valley Shuttle runs from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm every 30 minutes.

The reception ends at 10:00 pm -- don't miss the last shuttle if you plan on partying with us all night!


## [Childcare](#Wunderkind)
