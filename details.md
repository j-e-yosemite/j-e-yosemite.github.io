## Disclaimer!

As of March 1, 2016, Aramark has succeeded Delaware North as the concessioner for Yosemite National Park. Due to a [trademark dispute](http://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/news/yosemite-national-park-to-change-historic-property-names.htm), Aramark has changed the names of many iconic Yosemite destinations. In protest, we'll continue to use the names we know Yosemite by. To avoid confusion, however, note that:

* **The Ahwahnee Hotel** is now The Majestic Yosemite Hotel
* **Yosemite Lodge at the Falls** is now Yosemite Valley Lodge
* **Badger Pass Ski Area** is now Yosemite Ski & Snowboard Area
* **Curry Village** is now Half Dome Village

## Accommodations

Yosemite's National Park status prevents us from setting aside a block of rooms for our wedding. Although February is the low season for tourism, we still would recommend deciding your accommodations soon -- we want you there to celebrate with us!

## Things to do

####"Nature chose for a tool, not the earthquake or lightning to rend and split asunder, not the stormy torrent or eroding rain, but the tender snow-flowers noiselessly falling through unnumbered centuries." -- John Muir on Yosemite's glacial provenance

[Winter](http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/winter.htm) is our favorite time of year to visit Yosemite, when the crowds give way to Muir's snow-flowers carpeting the Valley. Yosemite's [website](http://www.travelyosemite.com/) is an excellent resource for planning your visit, but we have a few highlights below!

#### Badger Pass Ski Area

[Badger Pass](http://www.travelyosemite.com/winter/yosemite-ski-snowboard-area/) is California's oldest ski resort, and where Emily (and Sarah and Ann!) learned to ski! They offer backcountry ski tours, cross-country skiing, snow tubing, and snowshoeing in addition to downhill skiing and snowboarding. 

#### Curry Village Ice Skating Rink

The [Curry Village Ice Skating Rink](http://www.travelyosemite.com/winter/half-dome-village-ice-skating-rink/) is another way to immerse yourself in the winter beauty of Yosemite. It was originally built as part of a bid to host the 1932 Olympic Winter Games. 

#### Yosemite Valley Floor bus tour

[Valley Floor bus tours](http://www.travelyosemite.com/things-to-do/guided-bus-tours/) are available year-round to take in the sights of glacier-carved Yosemite Valley. 

#### Hike!

Spend some time in the quiet of Yosemite in winter snow. Hiking information is available [here](http://www.travelyosemite.com/things-to-do/hiking/).

#### Nature and history programs

The park provides [nature, history, and ranger-led programs](http://www.travelyosemite.com/things-to-do/ranger-nature-programs/) on the natural history of this striking place.

#### Other activities

Please see Yosemite's [Activities](http://www.travelyosemite.com/things-to-do/experience-yosemite-national-park/) page for a complete list!
