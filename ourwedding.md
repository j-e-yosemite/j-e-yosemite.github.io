4:15 pm

Attire: [Cocktail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of5QjLNnufg) / [Semiformal](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet)

## Ceremony and reception

### The Ahwahnee Hotel

#### 1 Ahwahnee Drive, Yosemite National Park, CA 95389

The ceremony will be outdoors on the Ahwahnee wedding lawn, a short walk from the hotel. Yosemite is gorgeous in winter and February may bring snow, so dress appropriately (particularly when choosing shoes)!  

## Other events

Yosemite is a spectacular, natural place. To honor the deserved enjoyment of all who visit here, quiet hours in Yosemite Valley begin at 10:00 pm. Thus ends our reception, but the Ahwahnee Bar will be open until 11:00 pm for those who'd like to revel a bit more with us!
