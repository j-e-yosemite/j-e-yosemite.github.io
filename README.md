### Travel and transport

#### Notable details

By law, tire chains must be carried in vehicles from October - April. For the latest updates on park conditions, call 209-372-0209.

The National Park Service collects an entrance fee per vehicle (link: http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/fees.htm), which is good for seven days.

Make sure not to leave any food in cars, or you might attract bears!

#### Airport

The closest airport is the Fresno Yosemite International Airport (FAT). The distance from FAT to the Ahwahnee is 96 miles. 

#### Parking

All parking in Yosemite Valley is free of charge. At the Ahwahnee, valet parking is available and complimentary.

#### Yosemite Valley Shuttle Bus

The free Valley Shuttle stops at all Yosemite Valley destinations, including the Ahwahnee and Yosemite Lodge at the Falls. In the winter, the shuttle operates from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm and runs every 30 minutes. The reception ends at 10:00, so if you plan on partying with us all night make sure you don't miss the last shuttle!
